## Visualization Setup

This snippet configures Matplotlib and Seaborn for high-quality, accessible data visualizations. It optionally boosts figure resolution with `retina` format, suppresses common warnings for cleaner output, and applies a Seaborn theme optimized for presentations (`talk` context) with a colorblind-friendly palette and a default figure size of 12x8 inches. Ideal for financial data analysis or similar projects.
